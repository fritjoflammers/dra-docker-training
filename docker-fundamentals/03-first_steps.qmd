## Learning objectives

- Be able check if Docker is installed on your machine
- Run and interact Docker containers
- Understand some important Docker commands and how to get help with the Docker CLI (Command Line Interface) 
- Finding new containers on Docker Hub

## Install Docker

## The Docker Command Line Interface (CLI)

Although Docker is now also provided with a graphical user interface, it is important to understand the command line interface (CLI) as it is the most powerful way to interact with Docker. Furthermote, if you work on a remote server such as a high performance computing cluster or a compute cloud, you will not have access to a graphical user interface.

Run your first Docker command. It should show you the version of Docker that is installed on your machine.

```bash
docker --version
```

To check that Docker is able to run containers, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker container ls
```

This command lists a summary of all running containers. If you have not run any containers yet, the output will be a empty table.

## Do you get an error message?

If you get an error message similar to the following, the underlying *Docker engine* is not running:

```bash
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```
:::


## Run the `hello-world` container

Now run your first container:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

Do you get an output similar to the following? 

If so, congratulations! 🎉 
You have successfully run your first container.

```bash
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

```

Let's break down what happened when you ran the `hello-world` container:

1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
2. The Docker daemon pulled the `hello-world` image from the Docker Hub.
3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

## The Docker run command

The `docker run` command is the most important command in Docker. It creates a new container from an image and runs a command inside that container.

1. **Starts a Running Container** - Starts a running container, based on the container image. Think of this as the “alive” or “inflated” version of the container – it’s actually doing something.
2. **Performs Default Action **- If the container has a default action set, it will perform that default action. This could be as simple as printing a message (as above) or running a whole analysis pipeline!

3. **Shuts Down the Container **- Once the default action is complete, the container stops running (or exits). The container image is still there, but nothing is actively running.		


## Understand the Docker CLI

The Docker command line interface consists of multiple levels. That means that you can run `docker` commands with different subcommands.

Invoking a Docker command always starts with `docker` followed by a command and a subcommand such as 
`docker [command] [subcommand] [additional options] `.

## Exercise: Explore the Docker CLI

Run `docker` to get an overview of the available commands. Explore some commands and subcommands. Which ones might be important for the rest of the workshop?

## Getting help with the Docker CLI
For every command you can add `--help` to get more information about the command and its options. For example, to get help on the `run` command, you can run:

```bash
docker run --help
```

## Run a command inside a container

Now that you have run your first container, let's do something that is a bit more useful.

Let's imagine for data science project, you want to use Python. Do you have Python installed on your machine? If not, you can run a Python container to run Python code.

```bash
docker run -it python:3.13-slim python
```

You should see a output similar to the following and are presented with a Python prompt:

```bash

Unable to find image 'python:3.12-slim' locally
3.12-slim: Pulling from library/python
13808c22b207: Pull complete 
6c9a484475c1: Pull complete

>>>
```

Type `print("Hello World")` or some calculation like `1+1` to interact with the Python interpreter.

To exit the Python interpreter, type `exit()`. This will also exit the container.
